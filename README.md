# NeedySystemOverdose

A fancy Python resource monitor for Windows (which, theoretically, should refer to the Needy Girl Overdose game). He seems pretty good-looking to me. If you don't think so, click on the "Fork" button at the top of the page. I will be glad to new collaborators :)

Maybe in the future I will come up with a couple more apps in this style. I really like this style, yes.
